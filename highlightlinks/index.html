                In the great green room
                there was a telephone
                and a red balloon
                and a picture of
                the cow jumping over the moon.
 
                There were three little bears
                sitting on chairs
                and two little kittens
                and a pair of mittens
                and a little toyhouse
                and a young mouse
                and a comb and a brush
                and a bowl full of mush
                and a quiet old lady
                who was whispering “hush.”
                
                Good night room
                Goodnight moon
                Goodnight cow
                jumping over the moon
                Goodnight light
                and the red balloon
                
                Goodnight bears
                Goodnight chairs
                Goodnight kittens
                and goodnight mittens
                
                Goodnight clocks
                and goodnight socks
                Goodnight little house
                and goodnight mouse.
 
                Goodnight comb
                and goodnight brush
                Goodnight nobody
                Goodnight mush
                and goodnight to the old lady
                whispering “hush.”

                Goodnight stars
                Goodnight air
                Goodnight noises everywhere.
